Add zen to your internet searches / history with Applescript

Elder Brother Yeap's Truth Stones 0.9b
--------------------------------------
This small Applescript puts unexpected but potentially useful context into your internet searches via organising pervious searches into web locations, which you can tap on the fly, by arranging Chinese ideogram stone icons in a folder “Zen garden”.

The reason the stones work is because they [attempt to] tell the story of life on Earth and the cosmic forces that guide it. So, unless you're really sure, don't alter the [1]woman [2]divert [10]exchange [15]eat initial configuration preset on the grid. Just add, move or remove stones around them, one per marker..

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you click around a lot you'll expose placeholder, blank icon files. Don't move or delete these as they help the script recognise empty spaces on the grid. If the script produces bad results, it could be that the placeholders are disturbed [faded stones]. Click the stones to bring them to the front. 

If the program stops working, it may be because the script applet is not launched [check your Dock]. Scroll down and Double-click it. If you need to re-compile Truth Stones, use the source file, Main.scpt, in Resources. Altering the dimensions of the window is not recommended as the script uses the borders to determine stone positions.

License

You can expand, copy, sell and distribute Truth Stones or port it to other platforms provided you include the name 'Elder Brother Yeap' or this file somewhere.
